# DEVELOPMENT
## Blog 1 - Goals
I started this project as a fun way to get into USB HID peripheral design. Two days of development have now passed, and I have realised I have not formally set out any project goals; so here they are:
### Ergonomics
Undoubtedly some of the biggest factors in building a custom mouse are its ergonomics. Whether you have a large (or small) hand size, weird grip or other needs, it can be incredibly useful to build and fine tune
a mouse to your exact needs. Whether its by changing the weight, shell type or handedness of the mouse, a mouse matched to your hand can make a world of difference. Personally, I wanted to try how a sub 20g mouse feels,
so there is my first goal.\

**Goal 1 - Total mass less than 20g exluding cable**\

*Very early case design where I was testing button spacing and total mouse length*\

### Customisation
Designing my own mouse, I am able to add (and remove) whatever features I wish. For example, I like the feature of being able to cycle through DPI stages directly on my mouse without the need for external software,
for this reason I implemented seamless DPI changing and storage on EEPROM.
